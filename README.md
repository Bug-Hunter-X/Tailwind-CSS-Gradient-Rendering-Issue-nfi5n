# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients.  The gradient, defined using `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`, does not render as expected in certain contexts. This issue might stem from various factors, such as conflicts with other CSS rules, incorrect configuration, or browser-specific quirks.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains code demonstrating the problematic gradient. The gradient is defined, but the visual output deviates from what is anticipated. The expectation is a smooth transition from blue to purple. The actual output, however, might show no gradient, an incomplete gradient, or a distorted representation.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution to rectify the rendering issue. This solution explores different techniques to overcome such challenges, including alternative gradient syntax, explicit gradient definitions, or troubleshooting CSS specificity conflicts.
